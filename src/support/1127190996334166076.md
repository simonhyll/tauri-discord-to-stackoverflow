# How can I make the Windows 11 window snap menu show up when hovering over a custom maximize button?
## Question
Is there a way to display the Windows 11 window snap menu when hovering over a custom maximize button? Are there any APIs or attributes available for achieving this, similar to the one used for dragging windows?
## Answer
Unfortunately, there currently doesn't appear to be a direct way to achieve this. The Tauri project, which is a framework for building native apps with web technologies, does not have any specific APIs or attributes for displaying the Windows 11 window snap menu.
